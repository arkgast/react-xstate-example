# State machine example with react

This is example is making use of xstate lib to handle state machine.

## Scripts to execute the project

    $ npm install

    $ npm start

## Theory

Finite state machines

* has one *initial state*
* has a finite number of *states*, this makes it deterministic
* has a finite number of *events*, the possible things to happen to the machine
* has a mapping of state *transitions* triggered by events
* has a finite number of *final states*
